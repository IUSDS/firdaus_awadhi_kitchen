          I grew up in the heart of Lucknow, in a joint family of 22 where every meal was a collective ritual and food was never just sustenance; it was a legacy. My earliest memories are of trailing behind my uncle through the bustling mandi, learning how to choose the freshest vegetables, or standing beside my father as he carefully selected meat from the butcher, discussing cuts like a connoisseur.
